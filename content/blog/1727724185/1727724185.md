This is my first blog post in _ages_. I'm out of practice and it's getting late, so I'll keep this one brief. 
I don't even know where to begin... and when we don't know where to begin, we know we can always fall back into the warm embrace of tooling ❤️ . 

# What am I cooking with?
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) -> I'm creating this blog as a static site with the help of Eleventy
- Editor: Visual Studio Code
    - Active plugins: 
      - Vim
      - Nunjucks Template
      - Markdown All in One
      - Code Spell Checker
- [Render](https://render.com/) -> I'm deploying the static site using Render

# Let's blog!
What is Eleventy? It's what I will use to generate my blog as a static website. [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) has had a lot of great press from the frontend community. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) also has appealing (and robust!) reputation after years of in action. I spent too much time trawling hacker news and reddit comments, and I've decided to try both. Eleventy is first up.

# Let's deploy!
I couldn't come up with anything clever to write so I thought to myself, "let's see if we can even get this thing off the ground". First, I'll start with some sane defaults using [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). After following some simple instructions, we have a dev server up with some fake posts showing us what can be ours someday:



<div class="wtf">
{% image "./hectic_starter.png", "A screenshot of the starter blog with fake posts" %}
</div>


<style>

.wtf img {
  max-width: 100%;
}
.wtf img[width] {
  width: auto; /* Defer to max-width */
}
.wtf img[width][height] {
  height: auto; /* Preserve aspect ratio */
}
</style>

# Next time
I'll talk about how I just spent 3 hours trying to get these images sized correctly and almost threw in the towel with Eleventy. Stay tuned.
